                of the most magnificent marine aquascapes of the world, where
                you will be surrounded by rainbows of tropical fish, rays,
                sharks, and vibrant coral reefs as you make your way around
                impressive underwater geological formations. While snorkeling,
                swimming and kayaking are great ways to see much of the marine
                life near the surface of the water, scuba diving lets you go
                even deeper and spend more time exploring. These tours are great
                for amateurs to experts.
